## Description:
This [paper](https://github.com/Rupeshwaran-Ravindrran/TensorMask/blob/master/Report_Paper.pdf) presents a GPU-accelerated real-time facemask detection system using the MobileNetV2 architecture. The proposed system utilizes the power of parallel processing on the GPU to improve the detection speed of facemasks in 
real-time video streams. The MobileNetV2 architecture is selected for its high accuracy and small model size, making it ideal for deployment on mobile devices and embedded systems. The system is trained on a large dataset of facemask 
images and non-facemask images using transfer learning. The experimental results show that the proposed system achieves a high detection accuracy of 95% and a fast-processing speed of 60 frames per second on a NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU. 
The system can be easily integrated into existing security systems or used to enforce face mask compliance in public places. The proposed system provides an efficient solution for real-time facemask detection with potential applications in public health and safety.


## Frameworks:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Caffe-based face detector](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

## Implementation Novelty:
Our face mask detector doesn't use any morphed masked images dataset and the model is accurate. Owing to the use of MobileNetV2 architecture, it is computationally efficient, thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/Rupeshwaran-Ravindrran/TensorMask/tree/master/dataset)

This dataset consists of __4095 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 2165 images__
*	__without_mask: 1930 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__ ([Link](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))

## Get Started:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Rupeshwaran-Ravindrran/TensorMask.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo 
```
$ cd TensorMask
```

3. Create a Python virtual environment named 'test' and activate it
```
$ virtualenv test
```
```
$ source test/bin/activate
```

4. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution:

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command:
```
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```
2. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:
```
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
## Results

#### Our model gave 98% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training via <code>tensorflow-gpu==2.5.0</code>
